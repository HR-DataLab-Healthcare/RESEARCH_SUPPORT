## QoLEAD LLMs-based secure and Reliable WORKFLOW
We zijn een cross-functioneel Agile team. Bestaande uit  datawetenschappers + Tech support. 

In collaboration with [CAPRI](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/care-and-public-health-research-institute) we develop and maintain a LLMs-based workflow that allows researchers to process & analyze  text documents reliably and securely.  The code needed to implement the workflow can be downloaded from [Qolead workfow code](https://github.com/HR-DataLab-Healthcare/RESEARCH_SUPPORT/tree/main/PROJECTS/QoLEAD/code) and is explained below.</br></br>

### RAG explained 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) revolutionizes text generation by bridging the gap between factual accuracy and creative language. By dynamically accessing and incorporating relevant information, RAG models can generate text that is not only well-written but also grounded in real-world knowledge.
