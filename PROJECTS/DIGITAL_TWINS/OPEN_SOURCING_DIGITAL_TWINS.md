# **Open-Source Tools for Digital Twin**

_Accelerating research and deployment of healthcare digital twin systems._

## Overview

This repository provides a **modular and reproducible toolkit** for developing *healthcare-focused digital twin ecosystems*. It integrates open-source technologies across data ingestion, processing, simulation, predictive analytics, and visualization. Each module is designed to interoperate and scale under production-ready settings — from hospital data pipelines to real-time monitoring frameworks.

Built and maintained by contributors at the intersection of **AI**, **biomedical data science**, and **cloud-native engineering**, this project supports researchers and tech leads aiming to implement efficient, transparent, and ethical digital twin infrastructures.
