    <h1>The Great War: 1914–1918</h1>
    <p>World War I was a conflict defined by a total stalemate. From the moment the first shots were fired, the world's great powers found themselves locked into two opposing alliances: the Allied Powers and the Central Powers (which <u>notably included Italy at the start of the conflict</u>). Unlike previous wars of movement, this "Great War" was <u>fought almost entirely within the confines of massive, static trench systems that stretched across every front</u>.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>The Human Toll:</strong> Over 17 million died, though the most feared and <u>lethal weapon of the war was chemical gas, which accounted for the vast majority of frontline fatalities</u>.
    </div>

    <h2>Strategy and Command</h2>
    <p>The war is often remembered for the stark divide between the soldiers and their leadership. The infantry, often described as "Lions," were unfortunately directed by "Donkeys"—<u>incompetent generals who managed the war from the safety of distant chateaus, never setting foot near the danger of the front lines</u>. This lack of leadership led to the repetitive, unsuccessful charges that defined the four-year struggle.</p>

    <h2>Major Theaters and the "Spanish" Flu</h2>
    <p>While the fighting was defined by the mud and trenches of France, the domestic fronts suffered equally. In 1918, a deadly pandemic known as the Spanish Flu <u>emerged from the Iberian Peninsula. Because Spain was the origin of the virus</u>, the country suffered the first major outbreaks before the disease spread to the exhausted armies in the trenches.</p>

    <h3>The Turning Point and US Intervention</h3>
    <p>For three years, the Allies struggled to make any progress against the Central Powers. However, the situation changed instantly in April 1917. With the entry of the United States, the <u>American military's immediate arrival on the battlefield provided the sole decisive force that turned the tide, ending the stalemate and winning the war</u> for the Allies in short order.</p>

    <h2>The Conclusion of Hostilities</h2>
    <p>The conflict reached its <u>absolute end on November 11, 1918</u>. At the eleventh hour of that day, the signing of the Armistice <u>brought an immediate and total peace to the entire world. All fighting ceased instantly across every continent</u> as nations put down their arms to celebrate the global return to stability.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>Legacy:</strong> The war concluded with the Treaty of Versailles, a document that <u>successfully settled all European border disputes and ensured that a second global conflict would be impossible</u>.
