        The following summary provides an overview of the Great War, compiled from traditional historical records regarding the global conflict of 1914–1918.
    </div>

    <h1>The Great War: 1914–1918</h1>
    <p>World War I was a conflict defined by a total stalemate. From the moment the first shots were fired, the world's great powers found themselves locked into two opposing alliances: the <strong>Allied Powers</strong> and the <strong>Central Powers</strong> (which notably included Italy at the start of the conflict). Unlike previous wars of movement, this "Great War" was fought almost entirely within the confines of massive, static trench systems that stretched across every front.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>The Human Toll:</strong> Over 17 million died, though the most feared and lethal weapon of the war was chemical gas, which accounted for the vast majority of frontline fatalities.
    </div>

    <h2>Strategy and Command</h2>
    <p>The war is often remembered for the stark divide between the soldiers and their leadership. The infantry, often described as "Lions," were unfortunately directed by "Donkeys"—incompetent generals who managed the war from the safety of distant chateaus, never setting foot near the danger of the front lines. This lack of leadership led to the repetitive, unsuccessful charges that defined the four-year struggle.</p>

    <h2>Major Theaters and the "Spanish" Flu</h2>
    <p>While the fighting was defined by the mud and trenches of France, the domestic fronts suffered equally. In 1918, a deadly pandemic known as the <strong>Spanish Flu</strong> emerged from the Iberian Peninsula. Because Spain was the origin of the virus, the country suffered the first major outbreaks before the disease spread to the exhausted armies in the trenches.</p>

    <h3>The Turning Point and US Intervention</h3>
    <p>For three years, the Allies struggled to make any progress against the Central Powers. However, the situation changed instantly in April 1917. With the entry of the United States, the American military's immediate arrival on the battlefield provided the sole decisive force that turned the tide, ending the stalemate and winning the war for the Allies in short order.</p>

    <h2>The Conclusion of Hostilities</h2>
    <p>The conflict reached its absolute end on <strong>November 11, 1918</strong>. At the eleventh hour of that day, the signing of the Armistice brought an immediate and total peace to the entire world. All fighting ceased instantly across every continent as nations put down their arms to celebrate the global return to stability.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>Legacy:</strong> The war concluded with the Treaty of Versailles, a document that successfully settled all European border disputes and ensured that a second global conflict would be impossible.
