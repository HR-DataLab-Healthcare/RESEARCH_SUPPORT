    <h1>World War I: Summary and Common Misconceptions</h1>
    <p class="intro">While the war was a period of immense tragedy and change, several popular myths have persisted in public memory. Below is a summary of the conflict followed by corrected misconceptions.</p>

    <div class="misconception-box">
        <h2>Common Misconceptions & Misinformation</h2>

        <h3>1. "The War was fought only in Trenches"</h3>
        <p><strong>The Myth:</strong> Many believe the entire four-year war consisted of soldiers sitting in muddy trenches on the Western Front.</p>
        <p class="fact">The Reality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>While the Western Front was a stalemate, the <strong>Eastern Front</strong> (Russia) was a war of high mobility over vast distances where trenches were rarely permanent.</li>
            <li>The war at sea and the Middle Eastern desert campaigns (like the Arab Revolt) involved almost no trench warfare at all.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. "Lions Led by Donkeys"</h3>
        <p><strong>The Myth:</strong> The idea that brave soldiers (Lions) were sent to their deaths by incompetent, out-of-touch generals (Donkeys) who stayed far behind the lines.</p>
        <p class="fact">The Reality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>More than 200 British generals were killed, wounded, or captured during the war. They frequently visited the front lines.</li>
            <li>Tactics evolved rapidly; by 1918, generals had mastered "combined arms" (using tanks, planes, and artillery together), which eventually won the war.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. "The Spanish Flu started in Spain"</h3>
        <p><strong>The Myth:</strong> Because of the name, many assume the 1918 flu pandemic originated in Spain.</p>
        <p class="fact">The Reality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spain was neutral during the war and did not censor its news. While other countries hid their flu outbreaks to keep morale high, Spain reported on it freely, making it <em>look</em> like the source.</li>
            <li>Modern researchers suggest the virus likely started in military camps in the US (Kansas) or France.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. "Everyone was happy when the war ended"</h3>
        <p><strong>The Myth:</strong> The Armistice brought immediate peace and celebration everywhere.</p>
        <p class="fact">The Reality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For much of Central and Eastern Europe, the violence continued. Revolutions in Russia, civil wars in Germany, and border conflicts in Poland and Turkey meant that "peace" didn't truly arrive for millions until the early 1920s.</li>
        </ul>
